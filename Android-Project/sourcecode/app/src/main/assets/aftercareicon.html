<p>

    If you or someone
    you know has
    suffered a loss,
    we at Mission Park
    extend our deepest
    condolences. We
    hope to help during
    this difficult time by
    offering you heartfelt
    support and caring
    advice with our
    variety of complimentary resources.</p>

<h2>Stages of Loss</h2>
<p>Much of grieving is about expressing emotion- some may be unfamiliar, and unacceptable to self or others, e.g. anger, guilt, remorse. Finding a safe place and an accepting person for support to work through all the effects of bereavement is important. The amount of support available from family and friends may be limited if they too are grieving. Misunderstandings can arise when people experience different responses to a shared loss. External supports may then become a vital factor in understanding and expressing your grief. It is important to know that you can survive the experience and that the new life that eventually comes about may have very positive effects despite the difficulty of arriving at this point.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to face reality when you experience the loss of a loved one. Knowing that everyone is uniquely different helps explain that there can be many different reactions to grief.
    It is important to understand that everyone experiences grief in their own unique way, that there is no timeline for grief, and that grief does not come in stages, but tends to be more cyclical in nature. </p>

<h2>Shock</h2>
<p>When loss is sudden and unexpected, your body may go into shock. This is a normal "self-protection" reaction. Usually it is for a brief period, depending on the severity of the loss and your emotional state of being at the time. </p>

<h2>Denial</h2>
<p>Because the loss is so devastating, you may refuse to accept facts, sometimes to the point of fantasizing that your departed loved one is still alive. This is a common occurrence especially with a sudden loss. </p>



<h2>Emotional Release</h2>
<p>Your emotions may be manifested by crying, venting of feelings, mood swings, and in some cases, screaming. These and other feelings can be a normal part of expressing your emotions. </p>



<h2>Depression and Loneliness</h2>
<p>You may experience thoughts of despair and occasional hopelessness. Knowing that these feelings are normal and will last (in most cases) for a brief period of time can be helpful. </p>



<h2>Panic</h2>
<p>Some people may occasionally experience panic attacks. You may feel something is very wrong with you, and perhaps even ask questions like, "Am I losing my mind?" Talking about and expressing these feelings can help. </p>



<h2>Hostility</h2>
<p>Feeling angry is not uncommon, nor is it unusual to be angry with the person who died. The important thing is to find ways to express your anger in ways that don't harm yourself or anyone else. </p>



<h2>Inability to Renew Normal Activities</h2>
<p>You may find that you just can't get back to "business as usual." Perhaps you may even feel that need to withdraw from people for a period of time. Use this time of solitude to take care of yourself. </p>

<h2>Guilt Feelings</h2>
<p>Guilt is a very common grief reaction. You may feel guilty about something you said or didn't say.
    Guilt is a very common grief reaction. You may feel guilty about something you said or didn't say. </p>


<h2>Physical Symptoms of Distress</h2>
<p>Recognize that your immune system is on overdrive during extreme stress. It is important to take care of yourself physically, attempt to eat healthy foods, get some exercise and try to rest. It is not unusual to feel extremely tired or lethargic in the first days and weeks following the death of a loved one. </p>


<h2>Acceptance and Gradual Recovery from the Loss </h2>
<p>Find comfort in knowing that your grief will not last forever. It is common for grievers to search for and find a new sense of wholeness and well-being. </p>



<h1>Losing a Child</h1>


<p>

    <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/aftercareicon2.png";  style="padding:10px;float:right;width:50%;height:20%;"/>

    The loss of a child,
    no matter what their
    age, is perhaps the
    most difficult grief to
    bear. The normal
    grief reactions of
    shock, denial, anger,
    guilt, and sadness
    seem to be magnified
    and extended when a
    child dies.</p>

<P><b>Everyone Who Knew The Child, </b>including the parents, will grieve the child's death differently. Some parents will find it very easy to express their feelings, yet others will have a more difficult time, keeping their feelings to themselves.
    It is important to remember that there is no "correct" way to grieve, and that men, women, and children all grieve differently. </P>


<p><b>Grief Does Not Come In "Stages". </b>Although the shock and numbness will eventually recede, the anger, guilt, and sadness will continue to come in waves for months following a death. Be patient with yourself; there is no timeline for grieving, and in general, grief lasts much longer than our culture expects. </p>

<p><b>Parents Can Be Overwhelmed </b>with guilt after the loss of a child. Regardless if their child's death was the result of an illness, accident, homicide, or suicide, it is not unusual for a parent to express the thought that they are somehow responsible. It is normal to have feelings of failure and thoughts of "if only . . . ." </p>
<p>Recognizing that these thoughts and feelings are irrational doesn't mean that you are "going crazy." They are part of the ordinary grieving process. It is helpful to find someone who will simply listen to your expressions of guilty feelings, without trying to talk you out of them. Eventually, if they are expressed, they will resolve themselves. </p>
<p><b>Anger Also Is A Natural Part </b>of the grieving process. Because the death of a child is inherently "unfair," anger is a normal response. Like grief, anger is not an emotion that most people are comfortable expressing, so it is common to keep it inside, increasing the danger that it will "explode" at some point. </p>
<p>In addition, grieving parents may attempt to smother their anger with drugs or alcohol. Besides the potential danger of becoming chemically dependent, drugs and alcohol delay the grieving process and also may further depress your mood.</p>
<p><b>Because Our Culture Is Uncomfortable </b>with grief and especially with grieving parents, you may feel awkward about letting people see your sadness. Give yourself permission to cry, even at unexpected times and places. </p>
<p><b>There Are Many Decisions </b>to make after a death and all are emotionally taxing. Attempt to put off making any major decisions until you feel more capable of handling them. For example, do not allow anyone to rush you into decisions about what to do with your child's belongings.</p>
<p>Some parents want to leave their child's room exactly as it was; others may want to box up everything. Both reactions are fine. If it is too emotionally painful to see their belongings, ask a friend to come over and box them up for you. Then you can hold them until you are better able to go through them and decide what you would like to keep. </p>
<p>Because the loss of a child is such a difficult grief to bear, you may find yourself unable to resume your normal activities, and even question your faith, or your sanity. </p>
<p>All of these reactions are normal. Remember to be patient, to give yourself time, and to find someone who will listen with unconditional love and support when you need to talk.</p>

<h1>Grieving During the Holidays</h1>

<p>

    <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/aftercareicon3.png";  style="padding:10px;float:right;width:50%;height:20%;"/>

    The holiday season
    can be especially
    difficult after the
    loss of a loved one.
    We have assembled
    a list of suggestions
    to help you deal with
    your grief during the
    holidays.</p>
<p><b>Plan in Advance - </b>In the weeks leading up to the holiday, discuss with friends and family what you would like to do and what situations you think may overwhelm you. Keep in mind that you probably won't all agree on a plan, and that some compromises will have to be made. If this is your first holiday since your loved one passed away, acknowledge in advance how difficult it is going to be. Whatever you plan on this year, you certainly can do something differently next year. For now, all you need to do is concentrate on the next several weeks. </p>
<p><b>Give Yourself Permission to Cry - </b>We are not a culture that is comfortable with grief, so it is especially difficult to be in mourning during a time of year that is supposed to be festive. Acknowledge that no matter what you do, the loss of your loved one will cause you pain. Crying is perfectly acceptable. Don't try to keep your emotions inside to spare other family members. Chances are they are thinking of the deceased as well. </p>
<p><b>Give Yourself Permission to Feel Good - </b>If you have a moment of laughter or a shared joke with someone, don't feel guilty. Holidays are a time for being with friends and family, and feeling light-hearted in no way means that you are forgetting the deceased.</p>
<p><b>Feel Free to Begin New Traditions - </b>This year won't be the same. Attempting to keep everything exactly as it was in the past will only serve to enhance the person's absence. If your loved one always hosted the holiday meal at their home, perhaps this year the family can gather in a restaurant or at someone else's home. Perhaps you can open presents on Christmas Eve, instead of Christmas morning, or vice-versa. </p>
<p><b>Slow Down - </b>This is an extremely hectic time of year, and you've been through a traumatic experience. You probably won't have the emotional energy or the physical stamina to do all the shopping, cooking, cleaning, gift-wrapping, socializing, and decorating that you are accustomed to. Do the minimum that will make you feel good, and don't be shy about asking for help when you need it. Now is the time to call all those friends/family members who said, "If you need anything call me." </p>
<p><b>Watch Your Alcohol Intake - </b>This is a time of year for parties, and it is easy to drink too much during these months, even if you normally drink very little. Alcohol, however, is a depressant, and it is very likely that your mood is very low. In addition, both grief and alcohol have an adverse effect on your immune system, and the combination of the two could make it much easier for you to become physically ill. </p>
<p><b>Don't Isolate Yourself - </b>One of the aspects of grief that is hard for others to understand is the effort it takes for someone in mourning to socialize. At the same time, it isn't healthy to stay isolated. During the holidays, as you are invited to parties or religious functions, it is important to keep this in mind. If you can, drive yourself or carpool with an understanding friend, so you can leave when you are feeling overwhelmed. Let people know in advance that you may "sneak-out" a little early. </p>
<p><b>If You Have Children, Include Them as Much as Possible - </b>Depending on their age and maturity level, children can be especially upset and anxious during the holidays. They may be hesitant to ask the adults in their life about the deceased, because mentioning that person's name may bring on tears. It is important to explain that it is OK if adults cry, and that although they are sad now, they won't always be THIS sad. </p>
<p><b>Talk to your Children - </b>It is very important to check in with your children and to ask them which holiday traditions are vital to them. For example, you may feel like you just don't have the energy to buy a tree and decorate it. However, for your children this may be much more important than decorating the rest of the house. Be honest about what you feel capable of doing, but consider compromising on some of their requests, as continuing tradition can help renew their sense of hope and optimism. </p>
<p><b>Find a Way to Memorialize Your Loved One - </b>Feel free to reminisce about past holidays with your loved one. Family and friends may be hesitant to mention your loved one for fear of upsetting you. As a result, you may feel as if your loved one has been forgotten in the holiday rush. Take some time to remember them in a way that is meaningful to you. You may want to give to a charity in their name, keep a candle burning in their memory, or plant a tree. Whatever feels right for you is fine. </p>
<p><b>Mission Park Annual Angel Tree Lighting Ceremony - </b>Many organizations and families have tree lighting ceremonies during the holidays. Tree lightings can be a way of remembering loved ones. Such ceremonies unite those who are experiencing similar feelings of loss. Coming together in this way can be a way of showing support to one another. <i>Every year Mission Park holds an Angel Tree Lighting Ceremony to help cope with the loss of a loved one. Families will have the opportunity to leave a message for their loved one on an angel ornament and place it on the tree.</i></p>
